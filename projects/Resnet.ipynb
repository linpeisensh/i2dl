To install PyTorch run `conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch`, with cudatoolkit set to whichever CUDA version you have installed. You can check this by running `nvcc --version`. If you do not have an Nvidia GPU you can run `conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch` instead. However, in this case we recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
